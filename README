Simplest possible C TCP/IP client example

./tcpclient HOST PORT

Connects to port and reads data "forever".

Example usage: replaces ACQ400 standard streaming command:
Streaming data with standard tool "nc"
[pgm@hoy5 ~]$ nc acq2106_059 4210 | pv > /dev/null
1.81MiB 0:00:04 [ 750KiB/s] [  <=>  

New Example:

Streaming data with custom TCP/IP client socket program
pgm@hoy5 TCPCLIENT]$ ./tcpclient acq2106_059 4210 | pv > /dev/null
2.39MiB 0:00:05 [ 662KiB/s] [      <=>   
3.09MiB 0:00:06 [ 710KiB/s] [        <=>  


What's the point of this?. 
tcpclient strips out the bare minimum from nc to make this work.
If you're simply outputting to stdout, there's no point, simply use nc.

However, users may want to build on the simple data connection to add other data processing.


To build on a Linux host:

make tcpclient

For windows build, we recommend using gcc and the gnu libraries, eg mingw.

Windows example
- recommend: use git-bash to git-clone this project
- use cygwin to compile and run. cygwin options can include gcc and pv
- or use WSL
